# IGAnets-Elasticity

This repository contains the development of a elasticity application for [IGAnets](https://github.com/iganets/iganet), a novel approach to combine the concept of deep operator learning with the mathematical framework of isogeometric analysis.

## Usage instructions

1. Create a `build` directory
   ```shell
   mkdir build
   ```

2. Configure `cmake`
   ```shell
   cmake <path-to-iganet-elasticity-directory>
   ```

3. Compile the code
   ```shell
   make
   ```
